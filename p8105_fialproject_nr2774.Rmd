List of things to do:
1. Clean the data (Keep counties and government city, remove Washington) (Justin- ask Tanvir about agency names as factor, Varvara - work location changing names)
2. Visualizations
-Bar Graph for mean base salary by municipality (Justin)
-Bar Graph for number of employees by municipality separated by leave status (Varvara)
-Boxplot for overtime pay by municipality (Nergui)
-Boxplot for total other pay by municipality (Justin)
-Pie Chart for the percentages and numbers of the different leave statuses (Varvara)
-Boxplot for Median base salary by pay basis by county (Nergui)
(Incorprate plotly into each)
3. Do ANOVA and Paired t-test analyses for the mean base salary by municipality (Varvara and Justin)
4. Do the Website (Nergui)
5. Do the Report (Group)
6. Do the Screencast (Group)
